# MKS22X-FinalProject

### **Project Description**
##### Bubble Bobble is a multi-level game, where the objective of the player is to defeat all monsters on screen in order to progress to the next level. The player first blows a bubble at a monster to capture it. Then, it must pop the bubble in order to kill the monster. When a monster is killed, it becomes a food item, which the player can grab to increase their score. The player has a total of 3 lives. If the player touches a monster, a life is lost. If all three lives are lost, the game goes all the way back to the beginning.
